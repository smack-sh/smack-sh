# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the custom Smack-7B AI model into the existing Smack AI platform, providing users with a powerful, locally-hosted coding assistant alongside existing cloud-based AI providers. The integration will offer seamless model switching, optimized performance for coding tasks, and complete privacy for sensitive code projects.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the Smack-7B model for code generation and assistance, so that I can have a powerful coding AI that runs locally and keeps my code private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects Smack-7B as their AI provider THEN the system SHALL route requests to the local model server
2. WHEN the Smack-7B model generates code THEN the system SHALL display responses with the same formatting and features as other AI providers
3. WHEN a user switches between AI providers THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and UI state seamlessly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Smack-7B model to start automatically when I launch the application, so that I don't have to manually manage the model server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically initialize the Smack-7B model server
2. IF the model server fails to start THEN the system SHALL display an error message and fallback to cloud providers
3. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL gracefully stop the model server

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the status of the Smack-7B model (loading, ready, error), so that I know when it's available for use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model is loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator with progress information
2. WHEN the model is ready THEN the system SHALL show a "ready" status indicator
3. WHEN the model encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display specific error information and troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Smack-7B model to provide fast responses for code completion and generation, so that my development workflow isn't interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests code completion THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds for simple requests
2. WHEN a user requests complex code generation THEN the system SHALL provide streaming responses to show progress
3. WHEN multiple requests are made simultaneously THEN the system SHALL queue and process them efficiently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Smack-7B model settings (temperature, max tokens, etc.), so that I can customize the AI behavior for my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses model settings THEN the system SHALL provide controls for temperature, max tokens, and other parameters
2. WHEN a user changes model settings THEN the system SHALL apply changes to subsequent requests immediately
3. WHEN a user resets settings THEN the system SHALL restore default values optimized for coding tasks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to intelligently route different types of requests to the most appropriate AI model, so that I get optimal results for each task type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a coding-related request THEN the system SHALL prefer Smack-7B for code generation, debugging, and explanation tasks
2. WHEN a user makes a general conversation request THEN the system SHALL route to cloud providers for better general knowledge
3. WHEN Smack-7B is unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to the user's preferred cloud provider

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor resource usage of the Smack-7B model, so that I can understand its impact on my system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model is running THEN the system SHALL display current memory and CPU usage
2. WHEN resource usage exceeds safe thresholds THEN the system SHALL warn the user and suggest optimizations
3. WHEN a user requests detailed metrics THEN the system SHALL show inference speed, queue length, and response times
