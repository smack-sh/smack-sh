/**
 * Creates a function that samples calls at regular intervals and captures trailing calls.
 * - Drops calls that occur between sampling intervals (only the last one in an interval is considered for trailing)
 * - Takes one call per sampling interval if available (executes immediately if outside an interval)
 * - Captures the last call as a "trailing" call if multiple calls were made within an interval, and no immediate call occurred.
 *
 * @param fn The function to sample
 * @param sampleInterval How often to sample calls (in ms)
 * @returns The sampled function, which will have a `void` return type as the original function's execution is asynchronous.
