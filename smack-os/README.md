# Smack OS - Linux Environment Preview

## Overview
Smack OS provides a full Linux operating system environment within the browser for the agentic AI system.

## Recommended OS for Remix/Vite Project

### **Best Choice: Alpine Linux**

**Why Alpine Linux is perfect for this project:**

1. **Lightweight** (5MB base image)
   - Minimal resource usage in browser
   - Fast boot and initialization
   - Perfect for WebAssembly/WASM environments

2. **Package Manager (apk)**
   - Simple and fast package installation
   - Excellent for development tools
   - Works well with Node.js/Remix ecosystem

3. **Security**
   - Minimal attack surface
   - Regular security updates
   - Used by Docker and containerized apps

4. **WebAssembly Support**
   - Can be compiled to WASM easily
   - Works with v86 (x86 emulator in browser)
   - Compatible with WebVM

### Alternative Options:

**Option 2: Debian (Buildroot-based)**
- More packages available
- Better compatibility
- Larger size (~50-100MB)
- Good for complex development

**Option 3: Ubuntu Core**
- Familiar to most developers
- Extensive package ecosystem
- Heavier (~200MB+)
- Best for full-featured development

### Recommendation for Smack:
**Use Alpine Linux** because:
- Your app is Remix/Vite (Node.js focused)
- Need fast performance in browser
- Agentic AI needs quick package installation
- Minimal overhead for better user experience

## Integration with Remix/Vite

The OS runs in an iframe using WebVM or v86 emulator, providing:
- Full Linux terminal access
- Package installation (apk add)
- File system access
- Network capabilities
- Integration with the AI agent

## Usage

The AI agent can:
1. Execute commands in the Linux environment
2. Install packages autonomously
3. Compile and run code in any language
4. Access the file system
5. Run servers and services
